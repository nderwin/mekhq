The planetary definition data resides in the data/universe/planets.xml and
the XML files inside the data/universe/planets/ folder.

Each of those files are a simple XML file with <planet> entries. The tag
names are case-sensitive. The files are read in a consistent order:
First data/universe/planets.xml, then the files in data/universe/planets/
subfolder, sorted case-insensitively. Information read later in the process
overwrites information read earlier.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
<planets>
    <planet>...</planet>
</planets>

Inside the <planet> tag, the following three tags are required:

<name>(string)</name> - the name of the planet
<xcood>(number)</xcood> - X-coordinate on the map, in light years
<ycood>(number)</ycood> - Y-coordinate, also in light years

The remaining information is optional:

<id>(string)</id>

Internal ID of the planet. If not set, equals to the name.
Used to allow multiple planets to share the same name.

If the same ID (or failing that, name) is encountered multiple
times, the later values overwrite the earlier defined values.

<shortName>(string)</shortName>

Short variant of the name, for display purposes.

<sysPos>(integer)</sysPos>

The planet's orbital position in the system.

<spectralType>(string)</spectralType>

The star's spectral type. MekHQ can parse most simple types like
"G2V", "sdM4.5", "O3IIIne", "B5V(e)+DQ6.2" and so on. If set,
the following three values are ignored.

Spectral types starting with "Q" are non-stellar points in space.
In particular, "QB" are black holes, "QN" neutron stars and
"QP" pulsars.

If missing, the spectral type gets generated from the following
values (spectralClass, subtype and luminosity). If those are
also missing, a procedurally generated "habitable" main sequence
dwarf star is set.

<spectralClass>(character)</spectralClass>

One-character description of the spectral class. Valid values
are "O", "B", "A", "F", "G", "K", "M", "L", "T" and "Y"

Ignored if spectral type is set. If only the spectral class is
set, subtype is generated randomly and luminosity is set to "V".

Also ignored if the luminosity is set to "VII" (white dwarf).

<subtype>(number between 0.00 and 9.99)</subtype>

Numberic sub-type of the spectral class. Ignored is spectralType
is set. Values can be given with any precision, but they are
rounded down to the nearest two digits after the decimal dot.

<luminosity>(string)</luminosity>

A valid luminosity identifier. One of the following values:

0, Ia0, Ia-0, Ia+, I, Ia, Iab, Ib, I-II, I/II, Ib-II, Ib/II,
II, II-III, II/III, III, III-IV, III/IV, IV, IV-V, IV/V, V,
VI, VI+, VII

The luminosity type "VI" are subdwarfs, "VI+" extreme
subdwarfs and "VII" white dwarfs.

Ignored if spectralType is set.

<nadirCharge>(true or false)</nadirCharge>
<zenithCharge>(true or false)</zenithCharge>

If there is a recharging station at the nadir or zenith jump point,
respectively. Both default to "false".

<orbitRadius>(number)</orbitRadius>

orbit, in AU. Defaults to roughly the middle of the habitable zone
of the star.

<orbitEccentricity>(number at or above 0.0 and below 1.0)</orbitEccentricity>

on the planet's equator, in hours.

<tilt>(number between 0.0 and 90.0)</tilt>

Planets with volcanism score of 6 are either just forming or in
the process of breaking apart.

<tectonics>(number between 0 and 6)</tectonics>

Relative tectonic activity of the planet. Defaults to "unknown".
Earth's is 2.
